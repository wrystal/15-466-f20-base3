# Crazy Driver

Author: Hao Wang(haowang2), Xiaoqiao Xu(xiaoqiao)

Design: 

A driver is retrograding on the highway at night. Unfortunately the lighting system of the car did not work. The driver needs 
to be very careful driving reversely. Put on your headphone and listen to the sound (car engine / car horn / siren sound) to 
help you drive. Remember do not get hit by other cars!

Note: 

* A car will honk its horn/siren only if you are driving on the their lane!
* There are sound spatial effect of other cars!
* There will be some random thunder / lightning  that may help you see the road!
